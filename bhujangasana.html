            <h2>Benefits of Bhujangasana Yoga Pose</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1. Strengthens the spine: </b></li>
                <li>Bhujangasana engages the muscles along the spine, particularly the erector spinae, which provide support and stability to the vertebral column.</li>
                <li><b>2.Increases spinal flexibility:  </b></li>
                <li> The gentle backbending action of Bhujangasana stretches and lengthens the muscles surrounding the spine, improving overall flexibility and range of motion.</li>
                <li><b>3.Enhances chest expansion:</b></li>
                <li>By opening up the chest, Bhujangasana allows for deeper breathing and improved lung function. It also stretches the intercostal muscles, which are responsible for expanding the rib cage during inhalation.</li>
                <li><b>4.Tones the abdominal muscles:</b></li>
                <li> Bhujangasana engages the core muscles, including the transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, and obliques, promoting muscle tone and stability in the abdominal region.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Precautions while doing Bhujangasana Yoga Pose</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>1.Back pain: </b></li>
                <li>Bhujangasana is a backbending pose, and it can put strain on the spine if it is not performed properly. People with back pain, especially those with herniated discs or other spinal conditions, should avoid or modify the pose.</li>
                <li><b>2.Wrist pain:</b></li>
                <li>Bhujangasana requires the use of the wrists to support the weight of the body. People with wrist pain or injuries should modify the pose by keeping the elbows bent and the palms flat on the floor.</li>
                <li> .<b>3.Neck pain: </b> </li>
                <li>The neck can be strained if it is not kept in a neutral position during Bhujangasana. People with neck pain or injuries should keep the chin tucked in and avoid looking up.</li>
