            <h1>Uttanasana Yoga Pose</h1>
            <p>Uttanasana is a standing yoga pose 'Ut' means intense, 'tan' means stretch, and 'asana' means pose. Uttanasana yoga intensely stretches the entire back of the body, including the spine, hips, and hamstrings. Hence, it is also called the Standing forward bend pose.</p>

            <h2>How to do Uttanasana Yoga Pose</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1: Stand with your feet hip-width apart</b></li>
                <li>Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward. Ground your feet firmly into the ground and feel your weight evenly distributed between both feet.</li>
                <li><b> Step 2: Inhale and extend your arms overhead </b> </li>
                <li>As you inhale, raise your arms overhead, extending them towards the ceiling. Keep your palms facing each other and your shoulders relaxed.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3: Exhale and bend forward</b></li>
                <li>With an exhalation, hinge at your hips and fold forward, bending your spine towards the floor. Keep your back straight and lengthen your spine as you reach towards the ground.</li>
                <li><b>Step 4: Bend your knees as needed</b> </li>
                <li> If your hamstrings are tight, you can bend your knees slightly to protect your lower back. Keep your legs engaged and avoid locking your knees</li>
                <li><b>Step 5: Reach for the floor or rest your hands on your thighs</b></li>
                <li>If you can, reach your hands towards the floor, placing them alongside your feet or on your shins. Keep your arms relaxed and allow your head to hang towards the floor.</li>
                <li><b>Step 6: Breath deeply and hold the pose</b></li>
                <li> Take a few deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling through your nose. Allow your body to relax and surrender into the pose. Hold for 5-10 breaths or longer.</li>
                <li><b>Step 7: Unwind slowly and return to standing</b></li>
                <li>To come out of the pose, inhale and slowly lift your head and spine up. Bend your knees slightly and use your hands to push yourself back up to standing.</li>
           </ol>
