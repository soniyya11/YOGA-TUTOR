            <h2>How to do Marjaryasana Yoga Pose</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1: Start on all fours: </b></li>
                <li>Start on your hands and knees, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your knees hip-width apart. Your spine should be neutral, and your core should be engaged.</li>
                <li><b> Step 2: Arch your spine :</b> </li>
                <li>As you inhale, arch your spine upwards, forming an "O" shape with your back. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your core engaged.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3: Round your spine: </b></li>
                <li>As you exhale, round your spine downwards, tucking your chin towards your chest and forming a "C" shape with your back. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your core engaged.</li>
                <li><b>Step 4: Repeat :</b> </li>
                <li> Continue to alternate between arching and rounding your spine, maintaining a smooth and rhythmic motion.</li>
                <li><b>Step 5: Deep breath: </b></li>
                <li>Pay attention to your breath as you move. Inhale as you arch your spine, and exhale as you round your spine.</li>
                <li><b>Step 6: Focus on your breath and body sensations: </b></li>
                <li> Bring your attention to the movement of your spine, the sensation of your breath, and the tension and relaxation in your body.</li>
                <li><b>Step 7: Hold for 5-10 repetitions: </b></li>
                <li>Perform the pose for 5-10 repetitions, gradually increasing the number of repetitions as you become more comfortable.</li></ol>

                <li><b>1.Strain on the wrists and lower back: </b></li>
                <li>The repetitive movement of arching and rounding the spine can put strain on the wrists and lower back, especially if the pose is not performed with proper alignment.

                <li> .<b>3.Increased pressure on the abdomen:  </b> </li>
                <li>Pregnant women or individuals with abdominal injuries should practice Marjaryasana with caution or modify the pose by keeping their knees bent and avoiding excessive arching of the spine.</li>
