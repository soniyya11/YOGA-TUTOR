            <h1>Trikonasana Yoga Pose</h1>
            <p>Trikonasana, also known as Locust Pose, is a backbend yoga pose that strengthens the back, legs, and arms, and improves flexibility and coordination. It is a beginner-friendly pose that can be modified to make it easier or more difficult.</p>

            <h2>How to do Trikonasana Yoga Pose</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1: Prepare the Mat. </b></li>
                <li> Find a quiet and comfortable space to practice. Lay out a yoga mat on a flat surface.</li>
                <li><b> Step 2:Starting Position</b> </li>
                <li>Lie on your stomach with your legs extended straight back, toes pointed, and arms resting by your sides, palms facing down.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3:Engage Your Core </b></li>
                <li>Draw your navel towards your spine to activate your core muscles, stabilizing your lower back and protecting it from strain.</li>
                <li><b>Step  4:Position Your Palms</b> </li>
                <li> Place your palms under your thighs, palms facing down. This provides support and leverage for lifting.</li>
                <li><b>Step 5: Initiate the Lift </b></li>
                <li>Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, press your palms firmly into the mat and lift your legs and arms off the floor. Keep your legs straight, toes pointed, and arms extended alongside your ears, elbows slightly bent if necessary.</li>
                <li><b>Step 6: Hold and Maintain </b></li>
                <li>  Maintain the pose, holding your breath if comfortable. If breathing normally, keep your breaths deep and steady. Focus on the engagement of your core and the lengthening of your spine. Aim to hold for 5-10 breaths or as long as you can comfortably maintain the posture.</li>
             </ol>
