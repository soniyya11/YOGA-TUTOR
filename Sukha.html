            <h1>Sukhasana Yoga Pose</h1>
            <p>Sukhasana is a simple asana which can be easily performed by people of all ages. It is as simple as sitting down on a flat surface. It is simply sitting cross-legged with a straight back and neck. This is the normal way of sitting in most Eastern cultures</p>

            <h2>How to do Sukhasana Yoga Pose</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1: Choose a comfortable sitting position</b></li>
                <li>Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Keep your spine long and your shoulders relaxed.</li>
                <li><b> Step 2: Cross your legs</b> </li>
                <li>Cross your legs at the shins, with one leg on top of the other. Your ankles should be directly under your knees, and your thighs should be parallel to the floor.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3: Relax your arms</b></li>
                <li> Rest your hands on your thighs, palms down, or place them in a comfortable position on your lap.</li>
                <li><b> Step 4: Lengthen your spine</b> </li>
                <li> Sit tall with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed. Draw your belly button towards your spine to engage your core.</li>
                <li><b>Step 5: Close your eyes and focus on your breath</b></li>
                <li>Take a few deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling through your nose. Allow your mind to become quiet and focused on your breath.</li>
                <li><b>Step 6: Relax your entire body</b></li>
                <li> With each breath, scan your body from head to toe and release any tension you may be holding. Let go of any thoughts or worries that come to mind.</li>
                <li><b>Step 7: Stay in Sukhasana for 5-10 minutes or longer</b></li>
                <li>You can stay in Sukhasana for as long as you like, but 5-10 minutes is a good starting point.</li>
             </ol>
